# What does it do and how to operate the printer?

This code will help give accurate bed tramming and will move the bed and nozzle automatically and will wait for you.

All you have to do is hit the pause button to let it know that you are ready to move to the next corner. The nozzle will infact move directly above the bolt of the leveling knob. Pretty cool huh? 

On startup the bed will preheat itself to 60 degrees and will position itself once it has reached temperature. The script will cycle 4 times and will return to position 1 to complete the 4th and final cycle. After the 4th cycle click the pause button again and it will home itself automatically aswell cool itself down. You just have to press puase one more time to continue out to the menu. You are all done and can now happily start printing.
